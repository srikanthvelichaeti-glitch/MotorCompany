# Austo Motor Company: Customer Data Analysis

## Project Description

[cite_start]This project analyzes customer data from the Austo Motor Company to understand key purchasing behaviors and identify opportunities for improving sales and marketing strategies[cite: 9, 10]. [cite_start]The analysis delves into customer demographics, financial status, and vehicle preferences to build a comprehensive profile of the typical buyer and offer data-driven recommendations[cite: 1, 9, 18]. [cite_start]The dataset used is `AustoAuto1.csv`, which contains 1581 customer records and 14 features[cite: 17, 36].

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    * [cite_start]Handled missing values in `Partner_salary` and `Gender` columns using median and mode imputation, respectively[cite: 31, 38, 39, 40].
    * [cite_start]Corrected inconsistent values in the `Gender` column to ensure uniformity[cite: 33, 41].
    * [cite_start]Checked for and confirmed the absence of duplicate records[cite: 42].
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * [cite_start]Created new features to enhance analysis, including `Age_Group` (categorizing customers by age), `Higher_Priced` (based on the 75th percentile of car prices), and `Partner_Working_Status`[cite: 27, 28, 29, 30].
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * [cite_start]Conducted a detailed analysis of customer demographics, including distributions for gender, age, education, profession, and marital status[cite: 76, 77].
    * [cite_start]Analyzed financial data such as salary, partner salary, and total household income to understand the financial profile of customers[cite: 171].
    * [cite_start]Investigated vehicle purchasing patterns, including top-selling models and price distributions[cite: 199, 226, 227].
* **Statistical Analysis:**
    * [cite_start]Answered specific business questions using data, such as determining the likelihood of a salaried person buying a Sedan and comparing SUV preferences between genders[cite: 353, 367].
    * [cite_start]Examined correlations between numerical variables like age, salary, and car price[cite: 242, 248].

## Key Insights

* [cite_start]**Typical Customer Profile:** The typical Austo Motor Company customer is a middle-aged (average age ~32), married, and educated male with 2-3 dependents[cite: 11, 55, 56]. [cite_start]The customer base is predominantly male, making up nearly 80% of the total[cite: 79].
* **Vehicle Preferences:**
    * [cite_start]Sedans are the top-selling car type, followed by Hatchbacks and then SUVs[cite: 201].
    * [cite_start]There is a significant gender difference in preference: over 50% of female customers prefer SUVs, while only about 10% of male customers do[cite: 354, 355]. [cite_start]Men show a strong preference for Sedans[cite: 203].
* **Financial Factors:**
    * [cite_start]A customer's salary and total household income are strongly correlated with the price of the car they purchase[cite: 13, 244]. [cite_start]Older customers also tend to buy more expensive cars[cite: 243].
    * [cite_start]Interestingly, the number of dependents does not significantly affect the price of the car purchased[cite: 13, 247].
    * [cite_start]Having a working partner does not appear to influence the purchase of higher-priced cars[cite: 408].
* [cite_start]**Loan Status:** A significant number of customers, particularly younger ones (ages 20-30), have existing personal and home loans, which may impact their purchasing decisions[cite: 12, 302, 303].

## Actionable Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended for Austo Motor Company:

* **Targeted Marketing:**
    * [cite_start]Focus marketing for higher-priced and luxury models on older, higher-income individuals[cite: 296].
    * [cite_start]Develop marketing campaigns that appeal to educated professionals and address the needs of families, focusing on space and features in SUVs and larger sedans[cite: 217, 219, 299].
* **Financing Options:**
    * [cite_start]Offer tailored and flexible financing options, especially for younger buyers who are more likely to have existing loans and be price-sensitive[cite: 71, 297, 326, 430, 434].
* **Product Strategy:**
    * [cite_start]Maintain a diverse range of vehicles at different price points to appeal to a wide customer base with varying financial situations[cite: 70, 346, 432].
* **Sales Approach:**
    * Tailor the sales pitch based on the customer's age and financial profile. [cite_start]Highlight affordability and financing for younger buyers, and focus on luxury, comfort, and features for older, more established customers[cite: 430, 431, 436].
